# Causality-inspired Representation Learning
This is an official PyTorch implementation of "Causality-inspired Representation Learning for Weakly Supervised Skeleton-based Action Recognition" which will be submitted.

## Evaluation
`python main.py recognition_cirl --config  xx.yaml --weights xx.pt --phase test`  
The WL-NTU dataset and trained models can be downloaded on [BaiDuYun](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1q4zInohlTWmaH640BRfwzg) code: 2wsf
